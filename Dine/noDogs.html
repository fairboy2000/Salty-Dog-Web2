                <h5>We love dogs at The Salty Dog Cafe* and welcomed them when we first opened in 1987.<br> <br>
                    
                    Lots of people came
                    to see us and many of them brought their dogs. Life was good – or so it seemed. Dogs of all shapes and
                    sizes accompanied their owners to lunch, dinner and happy hour. Along with the Poodles came German Shepherds,
                    Dobermans, Labradors, Rottweilers, and Golden Retrievers. On any given day there were a dozen (or more)
                    dogs at The Salty Dog Cafe. <br>
                    
                    If you allow several dogs of any variety in close proximity to each other,
                    add children with cheeseburgers and ice cream cones, then throw in a margarita for the dog owners and
                    the problems can begin. Owners would allow their dogs to lie in the walkways. Dogs ate off of forks and
                    out of our plates. Some dogs barked almost continually. Others begged for food and stole hot dogs from
                    little kids. It would be no exaggeration to say that many of the dog owners failed to control their pets.
                    So, ultimately the good dog owners suffered from the actions of the bad dog owners and we posted the
                    “No Dogs Allowed” signs in 1989. Why? Because we feel that we have a responsibility to provide our customers
                    with a clean, peaceful and safe place to dine. We do not feel that it is our responsibility to police
                    the dog situation – or to clean up after dogs or to referee dog fights. I’m uncertain if you have ever
                    witnessed the utter chaos that occurs when 2 dogs suddenly decide to attack each other in a crowded environment
                    such as The Salty Dog Cafe, but it can get really ugly. So, being fully aware of the consequences, we
                    no longer wish to subject ourselves to the disruption to the business or the liability.<br>
                    
                    <br>
                    And in all fairness,
                    our policy is not just limited to dogs, but extends to all animals, including pythons, cockatoos, and
                    monkeys, all of which have accompanied their owners to The Salty Dog Cafe. And, without exception, these
                    owners questioned our reasoning for not welcoming their companions to our restaurant. Which brings us
                    to the heart of the matter. 
                    
                    
                    <br>The Salty Dog Cafe is – first and foremost – a restaurant. And as our advertisements
                    state: a restaurant for humans. Our policy also extends to our outside tables because, in essence, our
                    outside seating is part of our dining room. This outside dining area also includes the picnic tables.
                    We tried the concept of allowing dogs at the picnic tables as recently as a few years ago. We felt that
                    it was time to relax our policy a bit, so we decided to give it another go. However, it didn’t take long
                    to realize that it was not going to work for the same old reasons; dogs on the tables, dog fights, &
                    dogs relieving themselves. Other than this brief period, the decision not to allow dogs at The Salty
                    Dog Cafe is long standing; dating back to 1989. Our reasoning comes, in part, from the old adage “there
                    are no bad dogs, just bad dog owners.” And generically speaking “everyone loves dogs, but not everyone
                    loves your dog.” And while we sincerely apologize to the good dog owners, it’s the bad dog owners who
                    have backed us into this corner. Over the past 20 years we have received many letters, phone calls and
                    personal contacts from dog owners who have questioned our position on dogs at The Salty Dog Cafe. Some
                    have the opinion that since we are The Salty Dog Cafe, then we are somehow obligated to allow dogs. On
                    the other hand, many of our customers are dog owners and they understand and support our policy. Just
                    as the majority of restaurant customers prefer to dine in a smoke free environment, it appears that the
                    majority of customers do not want to dine with a dog sitting beside them. In closing, we doubt that we
                    will change our policy anytime soon. We’re sorry; we tried to make it work on two different occasions,
                    but to no avail. So, we will continue to try and do the best job that we can in operating a restaurant
                    for humans.

                    <br>As a side note – Jake, the original Salty Dog, was adopted from our local shelter in the
                    early 80’s. In appreciation, we have continuously shown our support to Hilton Head Humane for the past
                    30 years and Salty Dog is proud to have contributed well over $100,000 to their organization since 1999.
